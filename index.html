                Step 1 : Have your Mom Throw It Out
            </h2>
            <p>
                <b>Yes. I know. It's very sad. I get the invitation from Alayna, I put it in my bag and wait for school to be over. The one day I actually have something of importance in my bag, my mom checks my backpack, thinks it's useless, and throws it out. The next day, when I am told to RSVP, the white envelope was no where to be seen. RIP my first invitation, and the only one with my name in script.</b>

                Step 2 : Have Your Dad Wash Your Lunchbox
            </h2>
            <p>
            <b>I know, I know. This might be pretty sad. But to not forget, I asked Alayna for another one at lunch and shoved it in my lunchbox so my mom wouldn't find out. This time, it didn't have my name, nor did it have anything in script. I thought I didn't need it until the day the RSVP was due. But like, I didn't think anything bad was gonna happen to my lunchbox. The next day, I think Ryan dropped my lunchbox which made the sauce inside of it spilled. And I went home, to ask my dad to wash it, and take everything out of it first before he washed it with alcohol. But he didn't. I came to school reminded of the invitation I was given the day before; and when I checked on it, yes it was still in my lunchbox. In one piece. Until I decided to pull it out of my lunchbox. </b>

                Step 3 : Discord Time
            </h2>
            <p>
                <b>Wanna hear a scary story. No wifi. Exactly. The day before the RSVP thing was actually due, I had to RSVP. So at 11 pm I asked Ryan to send me a picture of the invitation to Alayna's sweet 16. And obviously, my wifi decides to throw, so all the electronics in my house were rendered useless. So now it was time to admit to my sins. I know. I'm pretty cool.</b>
